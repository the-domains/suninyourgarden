The Sheer Brilliance Of Solar Energy Technology 

When you run around outside, enjoying the heat of a summer's day or the bright light at noon, you can thank the sun for your joy. Whether you're sunbathing on a beach or driving, the sun is what gives you the ability to do so. 

Using solar energy is another great perk, and this article will tell you how it's done.
Contact your local government to ask them about rules in place where you live. No solar technology should be in use without permission from the powers that be. 

You may find yourself fined and having to take down all that you worked so hard to put in place if you don't inquire first.
Switching to solar energy can save a ton on your electric bill. Solar power is absorbed through panels that are properly positioned on your roof. It is especially convenient if you live in an area that gets a long of sun. This will provide usable energy to your home in a much cheaper fashion than conventional electricity. 

Before purchasing solar panels, check the track record of the company that is selling them. Many panels come with lengthy warranty periods of up to twenty five years, but this warranty is only good if the company is still in business. 

Make sure to ask how long the company has been in operation and check ratings with organizations like the BBB before making your purchase.
Before you pull the trigger and buy a system, take a look at how long the manufacturer guarantees the product for. You want a fairly long warranty because the system will have to pay for itself over time and help you begin to generate a profit. 

Therefore, make sure the warranty is for at least 25 years.
Humans have taken advantage of the sun's heat for thousands of years. A lot of energy can be saved by drying your clothes outdoors in sunny weather. This cuts down a lot on the energy used to dry your clothing in an electric or gas clothes dryer, and linens dried outside smell great.
Try to choose solar panels that can have their angles adjusted easily. 

The angle at which the sun hits the Earth changes throughout the year. This means that the best angle to catch the suns rays can be very different between summer and winter. Ideally you want to at least be able to adjust the angle of your panels twice a year, however if you can find some that allow adjustments four times a year (spring, summer, fall, winter) that is even better. 

Cleaning your solar panels does not need to be labor intensive. You want to avoid abrasive soaps at all costs, as they can deteriorate and even destroy your panels. So long as there is not caked up dust or bird droppings, frequent rinses with just hose water should be more than enough. 

The sun helps us in so many ways, and with these ideas in your mind, you should be able to use it to power your life, too. Just make use of what you've learned and you'll find no struggle in obtaining solar power. Then you can switch from the grid to self-sufficiency.
